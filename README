Please check the code for specific function comments. I reproduce the discussion on representation
here again.

******************IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION*************************
I assumed that the triples that were to be returned were ALL the resolvents generated while looking for
the nil resolvent. I was not sure if the triples to be returned were to be the PROOF (i.e. all resolvents
that directly generate the nil resolvent in a sequence). Since the heuristic is good, the returned triples
do not contain a lot of useless resolutions. For instance, one proof consists of nine resolutions while
my theorem prover returns twenty five (the Criminal(West) proof)

Representation:
An SNF sentence is a conjuction of disjunctions. I refer to each conjunction term
as simply a clause. Since this is a strict requirement, there is no need to
represent logical connectives (AND and OR) in the input SNF sentence
The SNF sentence, for example, a knowledge base, is represented as:
(list clause1 clause2 ...). Being in a list implies that they are being ANDed
together. The list is REQUIRED even if there is only clause

A clause is series of disjunctions. I refer to each disjunction term as simply a term.
A clause is represented as:
(list term1 term2 ...). Being in a list implies that they are being ORed together.
As with above, this list is REQUIRED even if there is only clause

A term is any literal or compound or the negatation of each. Now, as above, I could
have simply represented negation by adding another nested list, I choose to, for
readability to simply represented a negated term as (list 'not term), where term is
is a literal or a compound.

The negated query is a clause (i.e. a series of disjunctions) and must be
provided as such

Variables are represented by prefixing them with '='. Example: variable x is =x

Constants are simply atoms (do not prefix them with = however)

Predicates and functions (skolem) are represented as compounds. Example: Knows(x,y)
is represented as (make-compound :op 'Knows :args '(=x =y))
Knows(Mother(x), John) is represented as:
(make-compound :op 'Knows :args (list (make-compound :op 'Mother :args '(=x)) 'John))

====================================================================

I present three tests and the results of running them. For each test, I present the English, the
FOL and the SNF clauses as variables (for easy modification etc.) Then I present the output. All
these theorems are true

To obtain a refutation, simply negate any negated query and rerun. I show this on Test 2, shown
below as Test 4.

These tests are simply the same ones discussed in class. The theorems are taken from the slides.

Simply copy and paste the entire chunk of defvars into the REPL and then simply run the atp
function as shown below for each test. The output shows the nil resolvent as the first entry in
the triple

English: Everyone is wealthy or greedy. John is not wealthy. Is John greedy?

FOL:    (all(x) Wealthy(x) V Greedy(x))
        !Wealthy(John)
 Query: Greedy(John)?
